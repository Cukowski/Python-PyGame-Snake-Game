# Python PyGame Snake Game
 Python PyGame Snake Game

* This is a classic Snake Game implementation from me.
* I used PyGame for this poroject

* You can adjust the speed in the message menu (slower, harder)
* The game will start with 10 squares and you need to eat foods to grow longer
* If you hit yourself, you will lose
* If you reach the end of the screen, you lose
* There are no obstacles yet
* When you play, it shows your score
