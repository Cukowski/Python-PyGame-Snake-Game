# Python PyGame Snake Game

## Description
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game follows simple rules: control the snake to eat food (represented by apples), grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or yourself. Itâ€™s a fun and nostalgic arcade-style game that demonstrates how to build games with Pygame.

## Features
* Snake movement: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.
* Food generation: Apples appear randomly on the screen.
* Growing snake: The snake grows longer after eating an apple.
* Collision detection: Avoid hitting the walls or yourself.
* You can adjust the speed in the message menu (slower, harder)
* The game will start with 10 squares and you need to eat foods to grow longer
* If you hit yourself, you will lose
* If you reach the end of the screen, you lose
* There are no obstacles yet
* When you play, it shows your score

## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed (Download Python).
Install the Pygame library:
pip install pygame

## How to Play
Run the game:
python snake_game.py

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
Eat apples to grow longer.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
